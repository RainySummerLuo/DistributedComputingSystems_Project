# Distributed Computing Systems_Project

Project repo for course: Distributed Computing Systems

### Overview

In this project, you are going to develop a **chatting software** using some distributed computing mechanisms in ~~**Java** and / or~~ **Python**.

Your software should at least implement the following features: 

- A user interface
- User identification:
  - By IP
  - Sever has a Database
- Sending and receiving text messages
- Working in a local area network

There is no limitation for other functions or improvement. You can design and add more accordingly. Here are some examples you can consider: 

- Sending and receiving files, music, video, etc.
- A pretty graphical interface
- Running program code remotely

### Implementation Requirements

You **must** use at least one of the distributed computing technologies, including the technologies we taught or not taught during the classes. Such as **Java RMI**, **CORBA**, **IIOP** we introduced during the classes. Or **modern RPC framework like GRPC and Dubbo**.

**HTTP and WebSocket is also allowed**, but **direct use of any existing software like Apache, Nginx is not allowed**.

**Direct socket programming is not allowed**.

You can oly use ~~**Java** and / or~~ **Python** as your programming language. No other language is allowed.

You can try your best to make better designs in software interfaces and structures. Then show them during your presentations.

### Presentation

Each of your presentations will be 20 minutes in length including demo and Q&A sections.

Your presentation should include a brief introduction of your feature, structure, and techologies used.

Your demo can be done on the PCs at computer lab. Please be prepared in advance and your time will be counted and no pause is allowed during your whole presentation.
